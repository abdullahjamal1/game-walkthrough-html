<h3 class="loc">Location: San Francisco , California</h3>
<div class="para">
<ol>
    <li><strong>Capture Power Plants to power the Time Machine.
</strong>
 <br>- There are eight lightly guarded civilian power plants in the city.  You'll
need to capture several of them to get your base out of lower power status.</li>
<li> <strong> Defend the Time Machine.</strong><br>

 - Einstein's Time Machine must not be destroyed by the Soviets (or Yuri).
</li>
<li><strong> Destroy the Psychic Dominator on Alcatraz.</strong><br>

 - Have Tanya swim over there, take out the dogs and soldies, then shoot the
barrels to gain access to the Dominator.  Detonate it, and the mission's over.
</li>
</ol>
 <h3>Walkthrough</h3>
 
 <div class="walk">
 
 <p>Gather a group of Grizzlies and your Mirage Tanks, then head for the south-west
corner of the map.  Wipe out Yuri's forces around the lower two groups of power
plants, then move east and north to finish off the rest of Yuri's forces.  When
the city is clear, use Engineers to capture the power plants until your base is
no longer low power.</p><p>

Now that the Time Machine is active, you'll be thrown back in time to the time
of the first Soviet attacks.  Use your Grand Cannons to shred the Soviet fleet
in the bay, and use a group of Guardian GIs to take care of the Kirov.  When
most of the city is clear, Tanya will show up.  Have her swim to Alcatraz, but
watch out for any ships that might still be roaming the water.
</p><p>
Take care of the dogs and soldiers on the island, then shoot the barrels next
to the fence to gain access to the Dominator.  Detonate it to end the mission.</p>

<h2 id="a2">2. Operation : Hollywood & vain</h2>
<h3 class="obj">Mission objective</h3>
<h3 class="loc">Location: Los angeles, California</h3>
<div class="para">
<ol>
 <li>Destroy all Grinders in the city.

 - There are only four, and they're not exactly well-defended.  A few Prism
Tanks will take care of all of them.</li>
<li> Destroy all Yuri buildings.

 - This map is considerably larger than it looks...  you'll have to sweep the
city as well as the hills for all of Yuri's base structures to complete the
mission.  Thankfully, he tends to surrender once you get him fairly worn down.</li>
</ol>

 <h3>Walkthrough</h3>
 
 <div class="walk">
 
<p>The only hard part about this mission is keeping your base protected long
enough for you to get a group of eight or nine Prism Tanks.  The computer will
send in waves of Lashers, Gattling Tanks, Initiates, and Yuri Clones pretty
much right from the start, so you'll need to move fast.  Use the five GIs you
start with to move west, where you'll find a civilian to add to your forces.
Garrison the large building next to the road blocks with your GIs, and deploy
the Guardians below and to the left of the building, near the ore fields.</p>
<p>
After you've placed your first power plant, build an ore refinery and a
barracks, then an Air Force Command HQ.  The two areas you'll want to protect
the most are the top of your base and the west side - line them both with two
or three Prism Towers.  Once you've got a good foot hold, build the rest of
your base and crank out a group of Prism Tanks (eight or more, preferably).
</p><p>
Take the tanks east along the bottom of the map to find the first Grinder,
which is hardly defended.  Demolish it, then collect the money crate it drops.
Continue north to find a tech machine shop - capture it with an Engineer, and
your vehicles will be automatically repaired.  Continue north to the next
Grinder, then head west to find the other two.  As you move through the city,
keep your eyes peeled for Yuri Clones.  If one takes over a Prism Tank, the
others will fire at it, which can completely obliterate your pile in a matter
of seconds.  Also be on the lookout for garrisoned buildings.
</p><p>
With the Grinders out of the way, you're free to move north and finish off the
rest of Yuri's forces.  Once you get him worn down, he tends to sell the rest
of his buildings, which will end the mission.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="a3">3. Operation : Power Play</h2>
<h3 class="obj">Mission objective</h3>
<h3 class="loc">Location: Seattle, Washington</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>1) <strong> Destroy Yuri's Nuclear Silo.</strong><br>

 - It's in the upper-left corner of the map, and it's not even really all that
well-defended.  A Grizzly rush in the first few minutes will take it out,
especially if you use the lightning storm a few times first.</p>

<p>2)<strong>  Liberate the MassiveSoft campus.</strong><br>

 - If you clear out Yuri's forces around MassiveSoft's campus, the owner will
leave money crates outside the main building for you.
</p>

 <h3>Walkthrough</h3><div class="walk">

<p>Send the two Engineers near your starting location to the oil derricks in the
south-west to capture them, then train two Snipers and build as many Grizzlies
as you can afford.  Ignore your forces in the other parts of the city for now.
</p>
<p>
Put the Snipers in the two IFVs near your barracks, then gather your Grizzly
pile.  Head directly north and assault the power plant there, using your
Sniper IFVs to take care of the Yuri Clones and Virus units there.  Mop up the
vehicles with your Grizzlies, then capture the power plant with an engineer.
</p><p>
By now, the first nuclear missile/lightning storm are probably ready.  Yuri
will almost certainly hit one of your two power plants on the right side of the
city, so don't worry about it.  Use your lightning storm to obliterate the
forces around one of Yuri's power plants to the west.  Move your tanks and
Sniper IFVs over there and take care of any survivors, then head north towards
Yuri's base.  (Watch out for garrisoned buildings - they can shred entire
columns of tanks in seconds.)
</p><p>
Yuri's base will be a cakewalk, but make sure you stay on the western side of
the map to avoid more garrisoned buildings.  Blast a whole in the wall, then
use your Grizzlies to destroy the silo.
</p>
</div></div>

<h2 id="a4">4. Operation : Tomb Raided</h2>
<h3 class="obj">Mission objective</h3>
<h3 class="loc">Location: Egypt</h3>
<div class="para">

<p>1) <strong> Destroy Bio Reactors around Great Pyramid to rescue Einstein.</strong><br>

 - The pyramid is surrounded by walls, and gattling cannons and psychic towers
are guarding it.  Take out all of the power plants inside the walls, and
Einstein will exit the pyramid.</p>

<p>2)<strong>  Destroy Yuri's base. </strong>

 - All of Yuri's buildings and units must be destroyed before the mission will
end.</p>

 <h3>Walkthrough</h3><div class="walk">
<p>
As soon as you have control of your forces, send Tanya north towards the water,
then slightly east towards the pyramid where Einstein's being held.  There's a
single barrel next to the wall on the south-west side;  shoot it, and a hole
will be made in the wall.  Tanya is immune to mind control, so send her in and
take out all of the Initiates in your way.  Destroy the ring of power plants,
and Einstein will exit the pyramid.
</p><p>
You'll have two minutes to use the dominator before it detonates.  Scroll over
to the far eastern base and use it on the cluster of Lasher tanks in the
middle of the base.  Everything nearby will be destroyed, and you'll gain
control of the Lashers.  Use them to destroy anything you can, though they'll
likely be toasted by Initiates before they can do too much damage.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, focus on defending your base with your four Tank Destroyers.  Once
you have a barracks, place two pill boxes on the north-western side of your
base and two more on the east side to stop the Engineers and Yuri Clones from
reaching you.  Try to get a few harvesters running as soon as possible, but
your primary source of funds will be the oil fields to the east.
</p><p>
Send Tanya down to the oil fields and have her clear out the Initiates and
Lashers in there.  Once it's clear, send her to the bridge to the east and
detonate it via the repair hut.  Use your chopper to send five Engineers over
there, and you'll have all the money you'll need.
</p><p>
Build a Battle Lab, then start building a group of Prism Tanks while you build
a Chronosphere.  After you place the Chronosphere, build a Spy Satellite.  When
the Chronosphere's charged, chronoshift a group of nine Prism Tanks north of
the eastern base.  Since Prism Tanks can shoot over walls, they'll be able to
shred the base with minimal effort.
</p><p>
All of Yuri's forces and buildings must be destroyed before the mission will
end, so you might have to hunt some stragglers down.  Don't forget the miners
in the north-west, and comb the trees to the south if you're having trouble
finding some well-hidden units.
</p>
</div></div>

<h2 id="a5">5. Operation : Clones Down Under</h2>
<h3 class="obj">Mission objective</h3>
<h3 class="loc">Location: Sydney, Australia</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>
1) <strong> Find and destroy Yuri's Cloning Vats.</strong>
<br>
 - The vats are inside a small base.  All you have to do is destroy them to
complete this part of the mission, but since you'll have to destroy everything
else for the second objective, you might as well cause as much damage on your
way down there as possible. 
</p><p>
2) <strong> Destroy Yuri's remaining forces.</strong>
<br>
 - Just like the last mission, all of Yuri's forces and buildings must be
destroyed before the mission will end.  Thankfully, the computer tends to
evacuate its garrisoned buildings and send everything at you once you destroy
enough of its stuff.
</p>

 <h3>Walkthrough</h3><div class="walk">
 <p>
Despite the urgency of the openning scene, the Boomers aren't really much of a
threat.  Build another Destroyer or two if you're paranoid, but it's not really
necessary.  Instead, focus on defending the right side (and bottom) of your
base.  Garrison the hotel near the ore field with some GIs as fast as you can,
and it should take care of most of Yuri's forces for several minutes.  Move all
of your remaining units west towards your shipyard - if you keep them on the
east side of your base, Yuri Clones can easily grab them and cause trouble.
</p><p>
Build yourself up the tech tree until you can get an ore purifier, which you
should try to do as quickly as possible.  After that, build a Battle Fortress
and stick a Seal and four Guardian GIs in it.  It'll be able to defend your
base for the rest of the mission unless you let a Yuri Clone get too close to
it.  If you're worried about that, just crank out a few Rocketeers - Yuri won't
send any anti-aircraft units at you, so Rocketeers will have free reign.
</p><p>
Once your defenses are stable, start pumping out Prism Tanks.  You can easily
finish the mission with six of them, but make sure you don't accidentally let
one get taken by a Yuri Clone while you're building the rest of them.  Once
they're ready, start moving south through the city.  Keep your eyes peeled for
Yuri Clones and Chaos Drones, and make sure you take out every garrisoned
building you come across.  I recommend you actually level the buildings
entirely, too, since units can hide behind them if you don't.
</p><p>
You'll encounter a tech hospital in the south-west corner, so destroy it.  Move
farther to the east to find the airport, then destroy it to stop Yuri's
paratrooper reinforcements.  Continue moving to the east, and you'll find
yourself underneath Yuri's base.  Target units first if you see any, then
destroy the base completely.  Once you destroy the cloning vats, you'll be told
to destroy the rest of Yuri's forces.
</p><p>
Continue moving your Prism tanks around the map, destroying anything you
encounter along the way.  If you hunt down all of Yuri's buildings, he'll often
evacuate all of the garrisoned buildings and send his Initiates at you in one
final suicide rush.  This is the fastest way to finish the mission, so move
north towards the water to take out the smaller base.
</p><p>
Once you've cleaned all of Yuri's forces from the map, the mission will be
complete.
</p>

</div></div>

<h2 id="a6">6. Operation : Trick or Treaty</h2>
<h3 class="obj">Mission objective</h3>
<h3 class="loc">Location: London, England</h3>
<div class="para">

<p>1) <strong> Defend Parliament from assault.</strong>
<br>
 - Yuri will send forces from all three bridges.  If the Parliament building is
destroyed, you fail.  Keep an Engineer behind it just in case you need to fix
it in a hurry.
</p><p>
2) <strong> Destroy Yuri's base.</strong>
<br>
 - After a while, the Soviets will send forces to join you in your assualt on
Yuri's base.  Use their boats to go up the river and destroy Yuri's shipyard
before it can produce more Boomers, then send a group of Prism Tanks to finish
off the rest of the base.
</p>
 <h3>Walkthrough</h3><div class="walk">
 
 <p>
 Deploy your MCV and start building a power plant.  Send your ten GIs into the
empty building near your starting position, then place an Engineer behind that
building as well as one behind the Parliament building - these will allow you
to repair the buildings quickly should it become necessary.
</p><p>
As you build your base, make sure you spread the buildings out as far east as
you can, and try to get a power plant or something right between the Parliament
building and your garrisoned building so you'll be able to build base defenses
above them.  The garrisoned building can pretty much handle everything on that
side, so focus your attention on the middle and the east.
</p><p>
Two Prism Towers and two pill boxes between the garrisoned building and the
Parliament building should handle everything that comes across the bridge as
well as anything that manages to survive long enough to get past the garrisoned
building.  Don't worry about anti-aircraft defenses - use a Battle Fortress
with five Guardian GIs in it for that (in fact, two of them is probably a good
idea).
</p><p>
Three Prism Towers is more than enough to defend the east side of your base,
but make sure you place them far enough to the east so they'll be able to hit
anything in range of the Parliament building.
</p><p>
By now, Yuri is probably launching his first attack.  If you managed to get
your base set up properly, the only thing you'll need to do for the next
several minutes is sit back and watch things get blasted, though you should
keep an eye on the Parliament building's health as well as the health of your
garrisoned building.  Repair any Prism Towers and pill boxes that happen to get
damaged, and be ready to send your Battle Fortresses towards Big Ben (the clock
tower) when you hear the warning about the UFOs.
</p><p>
Yuri's Floating Discs can cause a ton of damage incredibly fast, and they can
disable your power while they're at it.  A Battle Fortress fully loaded with
Guardian GIs should make short work of them, but make sure you don't
accidentally let a Mastermind or a Yuri Clone take control of one of them.

Eventually, Soviet reinforcements will show up on the river, and you'll be able
to use them to finish off Yuri's base.  Deal with the Boomers in the water,
then head up the river and destroy the shipyard before it makes more Boomers.
You can fire Dreadnought rockets at the base if you'd like, but you can destroy
it a lot faster with a group of Prism Tanks.  Make sure you bring at least one
of your Battle Fortresses along too, or a Floating Disc could easily wipe out
your entire group of Prism Tanks.

Destroy all of Yuri's stuff on the map, and the mission will end.  Luckilly, he
tends to sell all of his stuff and rush you after you cause a good deal of
damage to his base.

<h3 class="obj">Mission objective</h3>
<h3 class="loc">Location: Antarctica</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>
1) <strong> Build a Soviet Radar Dish.</strong>
<br>
 - Before you do this, you'll want to make a few preparations.  Mostly, you'll
want to build about six flak cannons on the south-east corner of your base.
Shortly after you build the radar tower, Yuri's going to start sending pairs of
Flying Discs at you.
</p><p>
2) <strong> Destroy the Psychic Dominator in Antarctica.</strong>
<br>
 - It's in the far south-east corner.  To avoid constantly getting your units
taken, this should be your first target once the Allied MCV arrives.  You can
destroy it with your nuclear missile and your lightning storm, so just don't
build any units until you've destroyed the dominator.
</p><p>
3) <strong> Destroy all Yuri forces.</strong>
<br>
 - The whole place is crawling with Yuri stuff.  Wiping it out can be a slow
process, but with the help of the lightning storm, nuclear missile, Iron
Curtain, and the Chronosphere, you can slowly chip away at Yuri's forces before
launching a full scale assault.
</p>
 <h3>Walkthrough</h3><div class="walk">
 <p>
 Take the power plant and the construction yard with your Engineers, then start
building an ore refinery.  Send two of the other Engineers to the west - you'll
find an oil derrick and a tech repair shop over there.  When you place the
ore refinery, avoid blocking any of the exits to your base.  Start building a
barracks and then some battle bunkers.  Place a bunker at the top, right, and
bottom of your base, then fill them with Conscripts.  This will be your primary
line of defense against the constant small attacks throughout the mission.
</p><p>
Before you build the radar tower, make sure you take the time to build a group
of about six flak cannons on the south-east corner of your base.  Yuri's going
to start sending pairs of flying discs at your base shortly after you place the
radar tower, so you'll want to be well prepared.  You might also want to
consider sitting back and letting your ore miners collect a large surplus of
credits before you place the radar tower, which will make the next part of the
mission a little less stressful.
</p><p>
Shortly after you place the radar tower, some reinforcements will be
chronoshifted to Antarctica, including an Allied MCV.  You'll need a lot of
power, so as soon as you place the radar tower, build a Soviet Battle Lab
followed by a nuclear reactor.  Deploy the Allied MCV as soon as it arrives,
then start putting down a powerful defensive wall on the east side of it.  I
suggest you use Grand Cannons rather than Prism Towers, since Grand Cannons
have much larger range as well as area damage.
</p><p>
By now you've probably noticed that there's a genetic mutator and a psychic
dominator counting down.  If you have any infantry on the map, make sure they
aren't inside your base where they can do any damage - stick them outside so
they'll have to go through your base defenses when the mutator goes off.
Except for the vehicles you received with the Allied MCV, you should refrain
from having any vehicles until after you've destroyed the psychic dominator.
</p><p>
With that in mind, start building a nuclear missile, then build up your Allied
tech tree until you can build a weather control device.  Use your nuclear
missile and your lightning storm to take out the psychic dominator, then use
them to take out the genetic mutator later if you want to use infantry for any
reason.
</p><p>
With the mutator and the dominator out of the way, you're basically free to
finish the rest of Yuri's forces off however you'd like.  You can create some
fairly devastating attack forces with Allied and Soviet forces, but keep in
mind that you'll be facing Yuri Clones, Masterminds, and Psychic Towers, so
you'll want to make sure you have a force that either isn't vulnerable to mind
control or has the range to kill things outside of mind control range.  Prism
Tanks are probably the easiest method, though Kirovs will also work if you
have the patience to use them.
</p><p>
Also, don't forget about your Chronosphere.  You can use it to chronoshift
clusters of enemy units into the water to get rid of them if you want, or you
can do something much more productive with it - build some IFVs and train some
Crazy Ivans (make sure the genetic mutator is gone first), then stick the Ivans
into the IFVs.  They turn into miniature nuke trucks, and if you chronoshift
several of them into the middle of part of Yuri's base, the damage can be quite
impressive.
</p><p>
Anyway, deal with Yuri's base and his forces in whatever way amuses you the
most, and when all of his stuff's been destroyed, the Allied campaign will be
over.
